To install, copy the contents of mt-static into your mt-static directory,
and then copy the contents of plugins into your plugins directory.

Add the following to your styles.css file for the blog where you will
publish this Action Stream:

  .service-bitly { background-image: url(<MT:StaticWebPath>plugins/bitlyActionStreams/bitly.png); }
